        Innovation - the latest from the ecosystem, be it cool hacks or proof of concept projects, complete new frameworks and techniques, or even promising future directions for BEAM-powered tech.
      </li>
      <li>
        Growth - how your team and your tools work together to overcome technical and other types of challenges to take your business to the next level, such as optimizing tricky business cases, on-boarding new members, or adopting new technologies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sustainability - everything that helps you stay productive, such as DevOp practices that help you manage how your software behaves in the actual production environment, or techniques and tools for fighting technical debt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Legacy - first-person accounts, holistic overviews or specific case reviews of rich heritage, and how they are helping shape the future of the ecosystem.
