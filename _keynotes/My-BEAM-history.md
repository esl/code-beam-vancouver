Join me as I take you on a personal journey through the evolution of BEAM, which I’ve been deeply involved with for nearly three decades. This session will highlight key moments in BEAM’s evolution from its early days as a fast but memory-hungry Erlang VM to its current role as a robust foundation for Elixir, Gleam, and all the other languages that run on it.
