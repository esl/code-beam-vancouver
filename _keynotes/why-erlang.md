In life we make many choices and this talk will give you some answers to the question why? Why become a programmer? Why work for Ericsson? Why work with functional programming? Why Open Source? Why do it for 20 years ? Would you also want to choose Erlang and in such case why? I can not give you all the answers but I can give you some reasons why!


**TALK OBJECTIVES:**

* To inspire everyone and especially encourage the minority of women in computer science jobs, to give some insights into Erlang/OTP history from my perspective, as a Erlang/OTP developer for Ericsson in general and then for the Erlang/OTP team, with focus of what happened after it became open source.

**TARGET AUDIENC:**

* Any one interested in Erlang/OTP and computer science
