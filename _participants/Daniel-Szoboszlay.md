Dániel spent 15 years as an Erlang developer, starting at Ericsson in Budapest, through Erlang Solutions all over Europe and arriving at Klarna in Stockholm. He loves working on the challenges of system reliability and scalability: areas where the power of Erlang really shines. He has most recently joined evroc to build a sovereign European cloud – no longer working with Erlang day-to-day, but definitely not leaving its powerful principles or vibrant community behind.
