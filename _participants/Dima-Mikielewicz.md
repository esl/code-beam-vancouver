4+ years of commercial experience, including 3 years as a Software Engineer at Software Mansion in Krak√≥w, Poland. Currently contracting for a large U.S.-based company, working primarily with Elixir. On a day-to-day basis, we work with an architecture handling tens of thousands of active users at a time, leveraging the strengths of BEAM, Phoenix, Ecto, and Oban.
