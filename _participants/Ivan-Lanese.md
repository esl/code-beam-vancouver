Associate professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of University of Bologna since 2018 (previously researcher since 2011), part of the Focus research group, joint group between University of Bologna and INRIA Sophia Antipolis. I work in the field of theoretical computer science, programming languages and formal methods. I have been author of more than 70 papers in international conferences and journals in the area. Recently I focused on studying reversible computing and in particular reversible debugging of concurrent systems.
