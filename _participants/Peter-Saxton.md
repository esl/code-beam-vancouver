Currently a reluctant Go developer working at Northvolt, where we are trying to save the world and help make "the worlds greenest battery". I am self made language nerd who like reading about type system and arguing which of HTML or Excel is the more widely used language. For the last year I have been building own language which is yet to find it's second user.
