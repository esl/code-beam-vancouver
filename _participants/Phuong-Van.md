Born and grew up in Vietnam, today Iâ€™m a developer and consultant at Erlang Solutions in Stockholm, Sweden. I fell in love with Erlang during my days in University and was fortunate enough to be able to work with it ever since. Using Erlang and later Elixir, I have been working hands-on with multiple clients: from a large-scale, legacy telecom product, to a user database service using the hottest and latest Phoenix LiveView.
