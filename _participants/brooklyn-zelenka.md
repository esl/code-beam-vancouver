Brooklyn is a distributed systems researcher, and is currently leading a local-first access control project at Ink & Switch. She is the author of numerous Elixir libraries including Witchcraft & Exceptional, and founded the Vancouver Functional Programming Meetup.

Her belief in open standards has lead to work spanning distributed VMs (Ethereum, IPVM), authorization (UCAN), data privacy (Webnative FS, RhizomeDB), multiformats, and others.
