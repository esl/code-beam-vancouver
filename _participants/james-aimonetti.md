For the last 15 years, James has been leading the development of the KAZOO platform, a distributed telecom infrastructure platform built to run across multiple data centers and scale to millions of endpoints. When not making the phones ring, he builds timber frame structures, carves spoons, tends sheep, and raises two boys with his partner.
