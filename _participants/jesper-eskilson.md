Jesper has written Erlang code since the late 90s, but spent many years working at IAR Systems writing Eclipse plugins for a C/C++ IDE while playing around with Erlang in his spare time. He joined Klarna in 2018 and got the opportunity to write Erlang code professionally. In 2020, he purged the venerable Kred code base from 12k Dialyzer errors, and has since 2019 been the Erlang Community Lead at Klarna, working with Klarna engineering teams to spread the usage and knowledge of Erlang at Klarna.
