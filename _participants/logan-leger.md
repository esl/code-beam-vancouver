Logan is an early-stage startup engineering leader with nearly 15 years of experience building products, teams, and companies. An entrepreneur at heart, he works across Elixir, Phoenix, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, GraphQL, and Postgres, helping shape scalable, consumer-facing technology. Logan is deeply committed to supporting others, offering portfolio reviews for underrepresented folks, advising on product and team development, and backing founders as an angel investor. Originally from Louisiana, he brings his home state’s spirit everywhere he goes. Outside of work, he’s a father of two, a comic-book enthusiast, a dedicated sports fan, and someone whose beard was once shaved off by Steve Harvey for charity.
