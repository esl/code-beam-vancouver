Stavros' experience with Erlang started at the deep end of the pool, when he picked Dialyzer, the famously "never wrong" tool, and made it even smarter, as a master thesis project under the supervision of Kostis Sagonas. He then made Dialyzer faster and parallel, an improvement that has been included in the Erlang/OTP distribution since 2012. Later he got his PhD by re-engineering Concuerror, another tool for Erlang developers, focused on finding concurrency errors in programs and protocols. 

 Stavros loves testing and making tools and is now trying to bring all his favorite techniques into the industry as an Erlang Solutions consultant and trainer.
