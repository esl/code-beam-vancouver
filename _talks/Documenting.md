In Erlang/OTP 27 a new way of documenting code will be added, documentation attributes. I will go through what the new documentation attributes look like, what makes it different from what we had before and how it may effect your project.

Finally I will show how the Erlang/OTP project was updated to use the new attributes and the tools used to generate the documentation.

**TALK OBJECTIVES:**

* To get an understanding of how documentation attributes work and the advantages to be gained by migrating your project to use them.

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**

* Any developer interested in writing great documentation.
