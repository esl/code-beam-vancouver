Diving into a new language can be pretty daunting. Falling into a new language by accident? That's a completely different story.

This talk will discuss how a series of unexpected events led to a career in Gleam, highlighting the lessons learned along the way, Gleam's strengths - and its pitfalls - and how to write production-ready Gleam code.

**Talk objectives:**
Talk about my journey from Python, TypeScript etc. to Gleam.
Show that Gleam has a very low barrier to entry.
Demonstrate Gleam's production readiness.
Show how my Gleam code has evolved over time, and talk about some Gleam best practices.
