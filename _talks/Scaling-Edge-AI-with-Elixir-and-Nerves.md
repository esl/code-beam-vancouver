Join us in this discovery on how to leverage Elixir and Nerves to build efficient, scalable edge-device AI systems on Raspberry Pi with the Hailo HAT. We will start with a brief overview on Nx and Nerves. Then we will get into the context of edge computing aiming to scale signal processing applications. By the end of this talk, we'll have built a self-contained on-device data capture and processing pipeline solution.

**Talk objectives:**
We hope to give the community a practical example and further insights into deploying machine learning models for real-time signal processing applications. In this overview, we expect the audience to better understand the challenges and trade-offs of edge computing, and walk away with actionable steps to accelerate your own ML projects on low-power, low-cost and high-performance hardware with Elixir!

**Target audience:**
Elixir and Nerves enthusiasts, Machine Learning engineers and Embedded Systems developers.
