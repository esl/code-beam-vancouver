Kivra is a company that allows users to get their official post in a digital mailbox. Invoices can also arrive in that mailbox and Kivra for a long time supports a feature to pay those invoices manually.
When a new feature of automatic payments was going to be added to this system, Kivra decided to take help of Quviq for additional testing support. With help of property-based testing the new feature and the interaction between the new feature and existing features has been extensively tested.
For Kivra, this meant extra resource to their development team focussing on quality assurance.


In this talk we give an experience report on adopting the new technology. We explain the benefits for, and impact on, the Kivra team.
