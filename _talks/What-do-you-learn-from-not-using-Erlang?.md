About a year ago I decided to make a big career change and after 15 years of working as an Erlang developer try “something different”. Not because I had enough of Erlang, but to catch up with the “outside world” after such a long time. What has changed? How does the Erlang ecosystem compare to its competition? It turns out I didn’t only get answers to these questions, but some more. What makes it easy or hard to onboard someone to not just a new project, but an entirely new tech stack? Do early-phase projects require different tools? Join me for this talk where I try to turn these questions around, and discover how we can improve our ecosystem and also the onboarding journey of newcomers!

**Talk objectives:**

* Reflect on a new user’s onboarding journey and collect examples of what are Erlang’s strengths that we could leverage to hook new users, and what areas are lagging behind other ecosystems, and how to improve them.

**Target audience:**

* People trying to improve the Erlang ecosystem or extend the community.
