An update on writing NIFs in zig. Previously this has only been available for Elixir. I'll show you how this library has achieved a very high level of integration between the zig language and the BEAM in general, and also I'll demonstrate leveraging the Zigler package to write nifs in erlang as well as Elixir.

**Audience:**

Show erlang developers the new low-level programming language "zig", and what writing nifs in zig can offer you.
