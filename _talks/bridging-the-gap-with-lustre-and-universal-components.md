You might have heard Gleam compiles to JavaScript, and maybe you've even heard it has a frontend framework called Lustre. But did you know Lustre can be used to author Web Components you can use anywhere, or that you can build real-time server components à la LiveView? In this talk we'll learn about "Universal Components" in Lustre and how you can leverage the patterns and concepts you're already familiar with from the BEAM to build interactive apps without touching a package.json.

**OBJECTIVES**
- Learn the different ways Gleam and Lustre can be used to build client side experiences.
- Gain a better understanding of Lustre's architecture and how it relates to the BEAM's actor model.

**AUDIENCE**
- BEAMers looking to leverage their existing knowledge to build frontend apps without touching React or a package.json.
