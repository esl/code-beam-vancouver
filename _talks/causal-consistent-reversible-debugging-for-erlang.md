Causal-consistent reversible debugging allows one to explore a computation backwards from a visible misbehavior looking for the bug causing it, following causality links and navigating among different processes. I will explain the main ideas underlying causal-consistent reversible debugging and then give a brief demo using the CauDEr reversible debugger.

**Talk objectives:**

They will learn what is causal-consistent reversible debugging, and how it can be used in practice via the CauDEr tool (admittedly a research prototype, not yet ready for production). Interested people may decide to join the CauDEr project to contribute making it production ready.

**Audience:**

Erlang programmers.
