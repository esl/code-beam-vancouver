Learn about how we leveraged AMQP as the transport for distributed Erlang and how you might build your own transport if you wish.

**TALK OBJECTIVES:**

* Introduce Erlang distribution and the mechanisms to create alternative transports; 
* introduce our amqp_dist lib and the learnings of running it in production.

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**

* Any BEAM operators who fancy using the built-in distribution mechanism but may have reasons to reach for alternative transports for it.
