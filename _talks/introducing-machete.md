For the reformed Rubyists in the crowd, the name 'RSpec' likely conjures up equal parts longing and frustration. When used well, RSpec can make your tests read like magic. When used badly, well, let’s just say that many of us are glad to no longer be working in Ruby.

Machete brings the best parts of RSpec’s magic to Elixir, allowing you to write ExUnit tests in a much more expressive and extensible way. We’ll take a tour through the library, see how it helps to keep your testing focused on your domain, and also explore some of the more esoteric features in Elixir that make the library possible.

**TALK OBJECTIVES:**

* Machete genuinely makes testing fun, and I want more people to know about it. In the three times I've given versions of this talk at local meetups and internally at PagerDuty, I've seen *multiple* folks have that 'A-ha!' lightbulb moment where something much bigger than just a test library becomes clear to them. The expressiveness of Machete lays bare much larger truths about writing good tests, and it's super cool to see people get jazzed about it.

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**

* Anyone who writes tests!
