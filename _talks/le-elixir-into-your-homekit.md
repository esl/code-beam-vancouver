HAP is the cherry on top of a multi-year yak shave I’ve been undertaking to control an air conditioner in our house with Elixir. Along the way I’ve built a couple of interesting libraries, including the Bandit web server that I presented at ElixirConf 2021. I’ve had HAP devices doing useful things in my house for the past year or so, and have had enough interest and participation that I think it’s a fairly broadly relevant and useful library for people to be aware of, which is what I’m hoping to do here.

**TALK OBJECTIVES:**

* Hardware hackers, folks doing Plug-level HTTP work

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**

* Elixir Controlled Lightbulb
