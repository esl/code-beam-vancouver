Understanding processes and supervisors in Erlang/Elixir can be tricky for beginners. When I was preparing to give a talk introducing Erlang and Elixir to developers in Vietnam, I thought of this idea to visualise how processes and supervisors works using Phoenix LiveView. A simple application was written and people was impressed by the power of OTP. It was a waste to just have it as a one time demo and I thought it could be helpful if you are a visual learner, with some quick setup, clicking and playing around, the demo can help beginners to understand more about processes and supervisors.

**Audience:**

Beginners learning about Erlang processes, hopefully trainers wanting to show their class about how supervisors works.
