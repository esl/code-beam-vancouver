This talk looks at how Elixir developers can simplify complex workflows by rethinking how we express composition. Ash Framework offers a compelling model: a DSL that feels like a pipeline but prioritizes intent and remains ergonomic in the way Elixir developers prefer to write code. We’ll look at how Elixir’s simple pipeline behaves once branching and error handling enter the picture and explore a solution that continues to prioritize intent and clarity.

**TALK OBJECTIVES:**

* The talk aims to show how Elixir developers can handle branching and uncertainty with clearer composition by learning from Ash’s intent-focused DSL and applying those ideas to pipelines that remain ergonomic and expressive.

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**

* Elixir developers who work with complex workflows and want clearer, more expressive ways to structure composition.
