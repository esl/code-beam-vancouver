In last year at WhatsApp we have successfully adopted static typing with [eqWAlizer ](https://github.com/WhatsApp/eqwalizer)across the whole code base. In this talk we overview how static typing helps scale development of large Erlang projects, what problems it solves, and why we did NOT use Erlang for implementing the type checker.
