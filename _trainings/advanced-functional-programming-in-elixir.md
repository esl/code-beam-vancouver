As systems grow, domain logic tends to sprawl: nested matches, tuple-shaped control flow, and fragile updates to deeply nested data. This course provides an efficient path designed specifically for Elixir developers: monoids for composition, monads for control flow, and optics for navigating and updating structure safely.

The focus is guidance. You’ll learn what to learn, in what order, and why, so you can apply these patterns with confidence.
